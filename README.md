A deep learning-powered attendance management solution leveraging computer vision and biometric authentication.

## 🔍 Overview
Manual attendance systems are inefficient, error-prone, and vulnerable to manipulation. This project aims to solve those challenges by developing a real-time Facial Recognition Attendance System using Deep Learning, OpenCV, and the Face Recognition API.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
Layer	Technology Used
Language	Python (3.7+)
CV & DL Libraries	OpenCV, TensorFlow, Keras, Dlib
Facial Recognition	face_recognition API (built on Dlib)
GUI	Tkinter
Packaging Tool	PyInstaller
Dependencies	Visual Studio C++ (for Dlib & CMake)

## 🧠 Methodology
This system follows an iterative development model with the following steps:

### Problem Crystallization
Identify inefficiencies in the existing attendance process (manual logging, delays, and human error).

### Requirements Gathering
Engage with stakeholders and gather both functional and non-functional system needs.

### System Analysis & Design

Design a modular client-server architecture

Implement secure database schema

Create intuitive UI for both staff and admin users

Select and configure optimal libraries for real-time processing

## Prototype Development
Build an MVP for early feedback and refinement.

## Implementation & Testing
Incorporate unit testing, user testing, and performance validation.

## 🧪 System Requirements

🖥️ Hardware Requirements
Component	Specification Recommendation
CPU	Multi-core (Intel i5/i7 or equivalent)
RAM	8GB (16GB recommended)
GPU	Optional but ideal (NVIDIA GTX/RTX)
Storage	SSD (256GB or more)
Camera	HD (720p minimum, 1080p preferred)

💽 Software Requirements
Windows OS
Python 3.7+
Windows users(developers) must install the Visual C++ package in order to build. 
CMake

PyInstaller (for packaging)
Upon the final version can move to docker.
